    <p>My name is Steven Meiers. I was born in Santa Monica and grew up in Brentwood. I attended UCSC, Santa Monica City
      College and have taken classes using UCLA's extension program. For employment, I have been a private tutor for the
      last 5-6 years teaching
      grades K-12 in History, English and Math up to Statistics. Prior to the coding bootcamp at UCLA my only experience
      coding was self-taught on my graphing calculator writing short programs to minimize the formulas I needed to
      memorize.
      <br>As far as hobbies and interests are concerned, I am an avid gamer, reader, skier and traveler. My all-time
      favorite game is easily Team Fortress 2 as I have logged almost 4,000 hours. My favorite book is the Hitchhikers
      Guide to the Galaxy
      by Douglas Adams, and I have reread the anthology at least once a year since I was 12. I have been skiing since I
      was 2 and have been to Mammoth Mountain every year since I was born. Finally, for travelling I have been fortunate
      enough to visit
      almost 30 countries, primarily in the Americas, Europe and Asia.</p>
